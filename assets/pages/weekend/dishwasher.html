						<h2>How to use</h2>
						The dishwasher can be found outside in front of the tournament hall on the left side of the main entry, when following the sign to sleeping hall 2 & 3. Every table can find their dishwasher schedule at next to the team labels of the table. If you share a table, please make sure to make clear agreements with each other.<br><br>
						Every table can use the dishwasher 5 times a day, and you can only run it <b>once</b> during your timeslot. Fill your basket before your time slot, because the dishwasher takes 3 minutes of your slot for one basket. There are more empty baskets than just one. Either they are on your table or at the dishwasher. Please check <b>before</b> your time slot begins.<br><br>
						You can start the dishwasher by pushing the big <b>green</b> button. If the button is (partly) blue, it means that it is running, so do not open it. <b>Do not hold</b> the green button, because then you turn it off.<br><br>
						If the button turns <b>red</b>, please inform the info desk immediately.<br><br>
						After emptying your basket, give it to the desk next to you.<br><br>

						<h2>Things to consider</h2>
						<ul>
							<li>Running the dishwasher once, means you can only put 1 plateau in.</li>
							<li>If you want to clean your cutlery, there is an extra unit to put them in. Be aware that this will take up half of your plateau. So be smart when you want to clean your cutlery (or discuss with neighbouring tables to see if you can combine your dishes more efficiently).</li>
							<li>Make sure that your dishes are dishwasher proof.</li>
							<li>Running the dishwasher takes only 3 minutes, so make sure the responsible person stays present during the run of the dishwasher.</li>
							<li>Remove any leftover food from your plates by putting that in your trash bag attached at the end of your table.</li>
							<li>There are multiple plateaus present at the dishwasher station, which means you can prepare your plateau 5 minutes before your shift starts.</li>
							<li><b>Be smart on how to use your timeslots and be on time!!! If you miss your slot you have to wait about 3 hours for your next one.</b></li>
