				<hr>
				<p>
					Dear presenters, we are relying on you to keep these festival goers raving all day and night.
					To prepare you, we have made this list of things we would like to ask from you and/or keep in mind.
					<br><br>
					Besides the common "quick, quick, slow" we have a large number of soundbites ready for you as well as a custom theme song.
					<br><br>
					We have a fancy <a href="#/weekend">festival app</a> with a live timetable, updated announcements, frequently asked questions, and more.
					Please have a browse through it, so you can refer to it throughout the weekend. Our motto for everyone will be: "See website!" (or rather "See festival app")
					<br><br>
					For this festival app, whenever you make an important announcement that is not just a short thing - E.g. A mobile phone has been found -
					please make sure the tournament desk adds this to the festival app.
					<br><br>
					We are looking forward to have you as our hosts. Please keep reading for all important information!

						<h2>To whom do I need to report?</h2>
						Unless given a specific instruction, you will have to report to the information desk. There you will be instructed further.

						<h2>Dress code</h2>
						We would like to ask you to go casual chic. Think adjudicator style! But feel free to go as fancy (or in theme) as you'd like.

						<h2>When to be present</h2>
						Please be present no later than 8:45 for a quick morning briefing.
						<br><br>
						At 08:50 we will start with the introductions of the adjudicators for the qualification round and the opening of the tournament.
						At 09:00 sharp we will start
						<br><br>
						The competition continues until about 18.30, after which you are free to go.

						<h2>Changes as opposed to other ETDSses</h2>
						The floors are not numbered A and B but 0 and 1. Here, floor 0 is farthest from the tournament desk and stage.
						In other words, viewed from the team tables, it is the left floor.
						<br><br>
						There is a beginners class that requires a count in.
						<br><br>
						The open class has a qualification round that then splits into two classes. No big deal. However, after this they go by the names:
						<ul>
							<li>Rising Ravers - Or Ravers for short - Which replace the Closed class (rising is to indicate the lower level)</li>
							<li>Risen Robots - Or Robots for short - Which replace the Open class (risen is to indicate the higher level)</li>
						</ul>
						Please use these names at all times (later on in the weekend you can switch to the shorter names)
						<br><br>
						The open class qualification as well as the ravers and robots have changing dances up to and including the quarter-finals.
						These will be simply pulled from a hat and will be danced in the order they are drawn in. The drawing should be done when the first heat of the dance is on the floor.
						However, the second dance will only be announced after all heats of the first dance have taken place. The same goes for the third dance.
						<br><br>
						The sleeping halls will be closed from 11-16
						<br><br>
						The prize presentation will be in the evening
						<br><br>
						The ravers and robots finals will both have 6 dances (which 6th dance will be announced after the semi final) and exactly 6 couples
						<br><br>
						The ravers and robots will have a lottery starting in their semi-finals. For the semi-finals, the order will be announced in advance through the portal.
						For the final, the order will not be announced in advance.
						Instead, please ask everyone on the floor and ask them to line up in the order we give you. You will simply tell them who will be dancing with whom.
						For the next dance, they will likely simply have to shift over one partner. But we will tell you on the weekend.
						<br><br>
						The team presentations on saturday are more similar to the NTDS-style team presentations. They have a total of 15 seconds combined for the walk-on and walk-off.
						In between they have a maximum of 30s of music. The music may slightly run into the walk-off, but the show may not last longer than 30s.
						Please make sure you or someone from the tournament desk times this. If they go over 30s the music should be cut.
						If no music was provided, simply announce the team normal ETDS style.
						We will provide you with a list and order for this.

						<h2>Things that we find important for you to do</h2>
						Whenever there is an announcement that could require team captains to write something down - for example the qualified couples for a class or round - please say something like:
						"I will now announce the results for... But first, team captains please grab you booklets" - give them 15s to grab the booklet and check if they're ready before starting the announcement.
						<br><br>
						If you keep seeing people with large piles of food during brunch, please remind them that they should only take 2 slices of bread each time to avoid food waste.
						<br><br>
						The website/festival app is the main source of truth for everything. So please remind people of that.
						<br><br>
						Please use as many future/festival related puns as you can, and use the soundboard a lot!
						<br><br>
						We're running on a really tight schedule, so delays should be avoided at all cost.

						<h2>If you have a question</h2>
						Your main point of contact will be Joanna Wytrzyszczewska, the manager tournament.
						Of course, aside from that you will have plenty of contact with the tournament desk and the orga.

						<h2>Food</h2>
						Food is arranged for you on both days. Brunch is available from 07:30 - 15. (That's right, all morning long breakfast) Soup will be added around 13
						If you need a break to eat, please ask Joanna to find a temporary replacement. Ilona has offered to be on standby whenever she is not dancing. (Although she might be judging)

						<h2>Dress code</h2>

						<h2>When to be present</h2>
						On Friday, please be present at 20:00 for an initial briefing. The official welcome will be at 20:30.
						After the closing of the blind dating, you are free to dance, but you may be called back for announcements until 01:00.
						<br><br>
						On Saturday, please be present at 21:00 for an initial briefing. The party opening will be at 20:30, but the evening programme starts at 21:30.

						<h2>Blind dating</h2>
						Your main task on Friday is managing the blind dating.
						<br><br>
						At 20:30, the orga will do the official welcome, after which we will introduce you, and you will take over.
						Immediately after the blind dating starts.
						<br><br>
						The order of blind date rounds is as shown below. For more information, see the weekend planning under the button above.
						<ul>
							<li>Blind date round 1 STD breitensport</li>
							<li>Blind date round 1 STD open + beginners (split floor)</li>
							<li>Blind date round 1 LAT breitensport</li>
							<li>Blind date round 1 LAT open + beginners (split floor)</li>
							<li>Free dancing</li>
							<li>Blind date round 2 STD breitensport</li>
							<li>Blind date round 2 STD open + beginners (split floor)</li>
							<li>Blind date round 2 LAT breitensport</li>
							<li>Blind date round 2 LAT open + beginners (split floor)</li>
							<li>Free dancing</li>
							<li>Blind date round 3 LAT breitensport + beginners (split floor)</li>
							<li>Blind date round 3 LAT open</li>
							<li>Free dancing</li>
							<li>Finalize blind date (split floor)</li>
						</ul>
						<br>
						The way a blind date round is structured:
						<ul>
							<li>In rounds 1 and 2 of both standard and latin, there will be 3 dances each and then again 3 dances each.</li>
							<li>In other words, for standard, it's SW TG QS SW TG QS.</li>
							<li>In every song, after every 30s of dancing ask the dancers to find another partner.</li>
							<li>For every dance there are 4 short sections of dancing.</li>
							<li>This means 4x(30+7.5)s = 2m30s for each dance.</li>
							<li>In total this leads to 15 minutes per round.</li>
							<br>
							<li>In rounds 3 of standard and latin, there will only 3 dances but you will play 5 sections of music of each 30s, totalling a round of about 10 minutes.</li>
						</ul>
						<br>
						During the finalizing round, it is your job to find partners for all remaining blind daters. So please find team captains willing to help for this.
						Nevertheless, blind date rules may never be broken! For the open class, you may ask the highest ranking breitensport class finalist to help in the open.
						Please check this with Remy.
						<br><br>
						On saturday there will be one more round of blind dating for each, after which the finalizing is done again.
