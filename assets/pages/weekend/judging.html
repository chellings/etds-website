								For the randomly selected judges, please read the next section.
								<br><br>
								First and foremost, you are NOT judging a national competition. You are judging an ETDS.
								This means that people are not used to dancing with each other.
								Partnering and musicality is of a much higher difficulty than just basic technique.
								Does the couple take a big risk to thrill the crowd, but in return slightly lower the technical standard?
								Does the couple have a large height difference, but do they still manage to show partnering even though the frame is not amazing?
								Those should be rewarded rather than frowned upon.
								Of course, technique still plays a large part in judging, but don't let it overtake your judgement.
								<br><br>
								On top of that, the ETDS is about fun. Both in the dancer and in the adjudicator.
								Unlike normal competitions, judges are allowed and expect to smile and interact with the dancers and even each other if the situation permits.

								Your job is to not look at technique. Your job instead is to identify the best couple in terms of choreography,
								musicality, audience interaction, couple interaction, etc.
								<br><br>
								Do you find this difficult? Think of the following things when you're judging;
								<ul>
									<li>Are they doing more than just basics?</li>
									<li>Do they dance not just on rhythm, but really on the music?</li>
									<li>Does their dancing make you feel something?</li>
									<li>Does the crowd go wild in multiple places when they go by (to avoid just hearing their own team)?</li>
								</ul>
								<br><br>
								Do understand however, that you have about 10s per couple at most to judge each couple. That is not a lot of time!

								While the doors of the venue will likely be opened as early as 07:00, please be present at the latest at the following times:
								<br><br>
								In case you are a randomly chosen judge, please be there at the latest at <b>08:30</b><br>
								In case you are adjudicating (even as a backup) the Breitensport Qualification round, please be there at the latest at <b>08:30</b><br>
								In case you are adjudicating (even as a backup) the Beginners class, please be there at the latest at <b>09:00</b><br>
								If you are only judging on or more of the other classes, please be there at the latest at <b>09:45</b>
								<br><br>
								The competition is planned to end at 18:30. Do note that this is an estimate time, and we may run late.
								While you are free to leave after your last final, we kindly invite you to stay for the parties.
								<br><br>
								Before your final goodbye, please make sure to check in with Remy to collect a small thank-you gift!
								<br><br>
								Make sure you are in the tournament hall at least 2 minutes before your round starts, so you can login.
								In case you are late to your round. Even if it is because you’re still on the toilet, we have a very important tournament policy:
								<div class="centeredButtonContainer"><b style="text-align: center">2 minute replacement</b></div>
								This means that if, for whatever reason, you are more than 2 minutes late, you will be immediately replaced by the first backup adjudicator under your name.
								That last part is due the limitations of the judging system. The replacement will last for that round only, so you can return to judging after.
								We understand that this is an unconventional approach, however, with 7 classes and over 600 couples participating every day, we cannot afford to run late.
								So please make sure you are on time, even with your bathroom breaks.

								After entering X (the venue), follow the signs to the tournament hall. Here you will be asked to show your wristband.
								Since you do not have one, inform whomever is at the door that you are judging and state your name.
								You will receive a badge. This badge is your proof of admission and will grant you access to the venue for that day as well as allow you to get food,
								so keep it with you! If you are judging both days, you will receive a new badge on the second day.
								<br><br>
								After entering, please walk to the opposite end of the hall, to the tournament desk.
								This is the set of tables on a stage. There, ask for Joanna Wytrzyszczewska!
								(Try saying that name 3 times fast!) As a tournament office manager, she will be your main point of contact for all questions during the weekend.

								The system is fairly straight forward to use. While you will hear the summary during your briefing, here are some quick pointers:
								<ul>
									<li>At the top of the screen you will see:
										<ul>
											<li>the number of (or range of) crosses you need to give,</li>
											<li>the number of heats,</li>
											<li>the name of the current dance,</li>
											<li>the number of crosses you have given,</li>
											<li>and the number of couples you have noted.</li>
										</ul>
									</li>
									<br>
									<li>The color of the top bar indicates the following:
									<ul>
										<li>Red: you have crossed too few or too many couples</li>
										<li>Green: you have scored the right amount of couples</li>
										<li>Blue: you have scored the right amount of couples but you still have some couples noted</li>
									</ul>
									You always try to aim for green or blue.
									</li>
									<br>
									<li>To cross a couple you tap the empty box below their number</li>
									<li>To un-cross a couple you tap the crossed box below their number</li>
									<li>To note/mark a couple for your own convenience you tap their number. The note is indicated by a number of dots.</li>
									<li>A couple can have 1, 2, or 3 dots/notes. You can use this, for example, to distinguish couples you have seen, may want to cross, or are sure you do not want to cross.</li>
									<li>In case the system is slow or fails to respond, please refresh the page or tap the top bar.</li>
									<li>In case the system does not respond even after a refresh, please DO NOT keep refreshing, but report at the tournament desk.
										Meanwhile, please finish the marking of that heat in a note on your phone or with pen and paper.</li>
									<li>In the finals, you score couples by tapping the placing next to their number.</li>
