						<ul>
							<li>In general make sure the hall is cleaned and looks super good for the tournament or party.</li>
							<li>Remove all trash bags and replace them with new ones.</li>
							<li>Make sure everything is clean and put stuff that is left around the hall in the team boxes or at the lost & found at the info desk.</li>

						<h2>I have a question!</h2>
						If you need anything or find yourself in a situation where you donâ€™t know what to do: contact the volunteer manager somewhere in the tournament hall.

						<h2>At the end of your shift</h2>
						Say goodbye to the manager volunteers, inform them of anything that they should know and release yourself from your shift.
