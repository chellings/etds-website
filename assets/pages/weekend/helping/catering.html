						<h2>Where do I report?</h2>
						At the beginning of your shift you go to the restaurant (X‐café) and look for the manager catering.
						Most likely, they will be walking around and coordinating the process; they will instruct you what to do.

						<h2>Where will the food be served?</h2>
						The food will be served as a buffet that is placed on long tables in a special section of the restaurant (X‐cafe).
						The buffet is set‐up in two identical lines where participants walk through the buffet from one side to the other.
						They will enter from one side, fill their plates with whatever they like, and leave on the other side.
						As there are 650+ hungry people that need to get food, your job is to make sure this process goes as efficiently as possible.

						<h2>Who can have the food?</h2>
						The food is available for those with a bracelet or with a special VIP badge.
						Visitors with a normal badge or people from outside the ETDS may not be served food.
						At the entry of each line to the buffet one of the catering volunteers is checking if the people in the line have a bracelet or a VIP badge.
						<br><br>
						The bracelets grant access to all meals. The VIP badges only allow the people to get brunch; no dinner or snacks.
						<ul>
							<li>If someone cannot show a bracelet or a VIP badge, they cannot get food.</li>
							<li>It is not necessary to mark or cross the bracelets or badges</li>
							<li>People can get food as many times as they like.</li>
						</ul>

						<h2>When will the times of catering be?</h2>
						There will be 5 moments when the buffet is opened: Friday late night snack, Saturday brunch, Sunday brunch, Sunday dinner and Monday breakfast.
						<ul>
							<li>On Saturday and Sunday there is a brunch which means that the buffet will remain open from 7:00 to 15:00.</li>
							<li>The brunch starts as a breakfast, and at around 12:00 a soup will be added. During this whole time, people can come in and get food.</li>
						</ul>

						<h2>What are important things to keep in mind?</h2>
						In order not to waste food and to keep the tournament hall free of full plates of food that never gets finished,
						we ask people to limit the amount of food they take per trip.
						This means that a <b>maximum of 2 pieces of bread will be allowed</b> at one time.
						If people are still hungry after this meal, they are free to come to the buffet again and fill up their plate again.
						<br><br>
						Please check if people are not taking too much and notify that they can come back as many times as they like.
						<br><br>
						Please check if people are not taking entire drink pitchers!

						<h2>Do I have to keep the availability of the food in check?</h2>
						The employees of the venue will make sure the food is available.
						However, the food is provided to us in large crates that do not fit on the buffet tables all at once.
						It is your job to set‐up the buffet by putting these items on the tables and refilling any items when necessary.

						<h2>Keeping things clean</h2>
						Please also pay attention to keep everything in good hygiene and clean up any spills when necessary.
						Especially take care around the tables with dietary restricted food that no cross contamination is done.

						<h2>People with dietary restrictions</h2>
						Vegetarians and vegans will be notified by signs at all of the (unobvious) items of the
						buffet to indicate if the product is vegetarian or vegan. In case of doubt about a specific
						product the manager catering can provide this information.
						<br><br>
						Personalized meals have been arranged for some people with very specific allergies that
						have indicated those to us. A list of people for which we have arranged such a meal will be made available.
						They should report to the manager catering and he/she will help them to collect their meal from the staff of the restaurant.

						<h2>I have a question!</h2>
						If you need anything or find yourself in a situation where you don’t know what to do: contact the manager catering.

						<h2>What do I do at the end of my shift?</h2>
						Say goodbye to the manager catering and release yourself from your shift.
