						<h2>Where do I report?</h2>
						At the beginning of your shift you go to the reception tables and report to the manager reception; they will instruct you what to do.

						<h2>What are my tasks?</h2>
						As a receptionist, it is your job to welcome our lovely guests and prepare them for our event. The procedure for every participant is as follows:
						<ul>
							<li>Ask their name and the name of their team and check if they are on the list of participants.
								<ul><li>If they are not, notify the manager reception.</li></ul>
							</li>
							<li>If they are marked as a student, ask them to show you a student ID or proof of registration for the current
								academic year.
								<ul><li>If they cannot show that they are a student, they have to pay a supplement to
									their entry fee. Ask the manager reception to help you with this.</li></ul>
							</li>
							<li>If everything is correct, hand them their entry bracelet and mark them as registered.</li>
							<li>If they ordered any merchandise, hand it to them and mark it on the merchandise sheet.</li>
							<li>If they are the first team captain from their team to register, hand them a TC flyer and the numbers for their team.</li>
						</ul>

						<h2>What are important things to keep in mind?</h2>
						<ul>
							<li>The reception will be set up with three queues based on the names of the teams</li>
							<li>People that are not participating in the tournament (Super‐volunteers/visitors/other
								helpers) don’t have to wait in line at the registration desk and can go to the tournament hall badge checkers directly. They will receive their badge there.</li>
						</ul>

						<h2>Someone needs to pay something, what do I do?</h2>
						All payments are done by card. Cash is not accepted.
						To find out how to process payments check the <a href="/#/weekend/helping/pin">pin machine help page</a> for more information.

						<h2>I have a question!</h2>
						If you need anything or find yourself in a situation where you don’t know what to do: contact the manager reception.

						<h2>At the end of your shift</h2>
						Say goodbye to the manager reception, inform them of anything that they should know and release yourself from your shift.
