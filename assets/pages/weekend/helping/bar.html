						<h2>Starting your shift</h2>
						At the beginning of your shift you go to the bar. There you will find the other volunteer that is scheduled for this shift,
						and the two volunteers from the previous shift.
						<br><br>
						The volunteers of the previous shift (and/or manager) will give you a short briefing and inform you of important information;
						please keep in mind that you have to transfer this information to the shift after you as well.
						<br><br>
						Take over the place from the previous volunteers and you can release them from their duties. You’re the barkeepers now!

						<h2>At the end of your shift</h2>
						Wait for the two volunteers from the next shift to arrive, provide them with the necessary instructions and release yourself from your duties.
						<br><br>
						If after 5 minutes past your shifts the next volunteers have not arrived, one of you should inform the manager volunteers (at the info desk).

						<h2>I have a question!</h2>
						If you need anything or find yourself in a situation where you don’t know what to do: contact the manager volunteers at the info desk.

						<h2>During your shift</h2>
						All payments are done by card. Cash is not accepted. For this, a tablet and a pin machine is used.
						To find out how to process payments check the <a href="/#/weekend/helping/pin">pin machine help page</a> for more information.
						<br><br>
						The bar cannot be left alone! If you have to go to the bathroom or leave your place at any time during the shift,
						please make sure that there is always at least one person at the bar.
						<br><br>
						If drinks are almost finished, you can find more in the changing room designated for storage and first-aid. The manager volunteers will have the key.
						<br><br>
						While serving drinks in glasses, bottles are cheaper. All bottles should be returned to the bar, rather than be thrown away. Please stress this!
						We get very angry about not-returned bottles!
						<br><br>
						If someone is very drunk or acting irresponsibly, refuse to serve them further alcoholic drinks and notify the manager volunteers.
						<br><br>
						We are not allowed to serve drinks to people that do not belong to the ETDS.
						If you get the impression that somebody that does not belong to the ETDS slipped past the badge checkers you can ask them to show their bracelet or visitor badge.
						If they cannot show a bracelet or a badge you refuse to take their order and directly notify the manager volunteers.
						<br><br>
						Giving away drinks for free is not allowed, including yourself, super‐volunteers, managers and/or judges.
						Unless if instructed specifically by the ETDS committee everybody should pay for their drinks.

						<h2>Are there any minors?</h2>
						Among all participants, there should be only one minor. We know who that is and they are under strict supervision. However, we have less knowledge regarding visitors.
						When in doubt, do not sell alcohol to minors! You may ask for ID or for confirmation from their team captain.
