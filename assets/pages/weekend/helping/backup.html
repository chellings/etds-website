						<h2>Can I do something else while it's my shift and I haven't been called for?</h2>
						Yes, while you haven't been asked to report for your shift, you can do whatever you want as long as you are able to report at short notice.
						In case you leave the tournament hall, make sure your team captain or a team member knows where you are.
