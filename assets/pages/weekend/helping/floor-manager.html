						<h2>When do I have to be there?</h2>
						Please report at the tournament desk at at least five minutes before the start of your shift. This is to make sure there is enough transfer time.
						<h2>To whom do I need to report?</h2>
						The tournament manager for the entire weekend is Joanna Wytrzyszczewska. For any questions, go to her or to the tournament chairman.
						<h2>At the end of your shift</h2>
						Wait for the volunteer of the next shift to arrive, provide them with the necessary instructions and release yourself from your duties.
						<br><br>
						If after 5 minutes past your shifts the next volunteer has not arrived, you should inform the manager tournament (at the tournament desk).

						<h2>Replacement</h2>
						As a floor manager, you will be on duty during either the breitensport rounds or during the open + beginner rounds.
						During the other rounds, another person will take over. In this way, you can dance during your own rounds, and be floor manager during the others.
						<br><br>
						This can get quite hectic and require you to do your floor manager shift after dancing without a break.
						In general, please try to report to the manager tournament as soon as possible when your duty starts.
						<br><br>
						If you really need some rest, have to go to the toilet, or need to get lunch before starting your duty,
						please first report to the manager tournament before going; they will arrange for one of the heroes to take over while you’re away.
						This way the show can go on, and we don’t have to wait for you.
						<br><br>
						If you have to leave your place for whatever reason during your shift, make sure that the manager tournament knows and can arrange for a replacement;
						the tournament cannot go on without floor managers.

						<h2>During your shift</h2>
						Your job is to make sure all couples are present before their heat and are lined up for the correct floor.
						<br><br>
						There are two floors for all rounds upto and including the quarter-finals.
						The floor farthest away from the stage is floor 0. The floor closest to the stage is floor 1.
						The lower class will always dance on floor 0 and the higher class on floor 1.
						<br><br>
						As a floor manager, you will be at the place where the couples enter the dance floor,
						and it is your job to make sure the tournament office knows if the upcoming heat is complete or not; you do this by crossing their numbers on a tablet.
						<ul>
							<li>Walk past the couples waiting for their heat and cross their number on the tablet if both the lead and follow are present and are in the upcoming heat.</li>
							<li>If the couples are not in the upcoming heat, instruct them to wait further in the back to make place for the couples that should be in the next heat.
								In general, make sure to keep the waiting line organised such that every couple knows where they should wait.</li>
							<li>If the heat is complete, great! You can already continue with the next heat.</li>
							<li><b>Important:</b>To avoid delays, please encourage the couples to come on the floor AS the other couples are walking off of the floor. Not AFTER!</li>
						</ul>
						<br>
						If you did not manage to find and cross all couples and the previous heat is finished, do the following things:
						<ul>
							<li>Check if the couple you’re missing has slipped past you and is in the line after all.</li>
							<li>Check if the couple is already on the floor (this can happen if they danced in the last heat of the previous dance).</li>
							<li>Shout their number at the line waiting for the next heats to see if they are waiting for the wrong heat.</li>
							<li>Try to do everything you can to find them before the next heat starts.</li>
						</ul>
						<br>
						In case the couple is not present, please make sure the presenter or the tournament desk notices this so they can call them out.
						<br><br>
						In case a couple is late to their heat, they will be transferred to the last heat.
