						<h2>What is my job?</h2>
						In this job, your main task is to check on other volunteers and judges and provide them with food
						and drinks. Aside of this you will keep the tournament and sleeping halls tidy as well as help with any tasks where you’re needed at that point.
						<br><br>
						Housekeeping of the tournament hall is pretty easy for the most part. We already instructed our team captains that they should urge their participants to clean
						up their mess during the tournaments and parties. However, accidents can always happen, and that is why we need you.
						<h2>What tasks should be doing if you don't have specific tasks for me?</h2>
						Unless given a specific instruction, you will have to report to the information desk. There you will be instructed further.
						<h2>What kind of tasks would I be doing?</h2>
						<ul>
							<li>Assist any orga or manager with anything.</li>
							<li>Go around the changing rooms, showers and toilets to clean or supply where necessary.</li>
							<li>Go the halls and clean where necessary.</li>
							<li>Go the helper posts and assist them if necessary or get them nourishment.</li>
						</ul>
						More information on the specifics below.

						<h2>Sanitation</h2>
						Focus is on the toilets, showers and changing rooms. Cleaning supplies are available at the information desk (or at least they should know about it).
						Pay attention to the following:
						<ul>
							<li>Toilet paper: for each toilet, one roll at service and six spares.</li>
							<li>Showers and clothing rooms: remove cosmetics leftovers such as spilled shampoo or shower gel,
							as well as other stuff that does not belong there. Also remove traces of hairspray and make up, especially from the mirrors.</li>
							<li>Check if all soap dispensers are filled sufficiently. Add and/or replace if needed.</li>
							<li>Collect all garbage and replace full garbage bags with empty ones.</li>
						</ul>
						Spread a friendly and happy attitude. The ETDS is a fun event.
						If you need to intervene, greet the dancers and wish them all the best when they are in the tournament(s).

						<h2>Sleeping halls</h2>
						All of our participants’ belongings must be placed inside the marked areas; the pathways are not allowed to be blocked by objects of any kind or size.
						When you are done, check if suitcases and similar objects do not block the emergency exits.

						<h2>During the parties and tournaments</h2>
						About every 20 minutes, take a look around through the entire hall if you see something irregular.
						Think of a bag full of garbage, food and drinks being spilled, and so on. You may be asked to sweep the floor if there is too much dirt or dust on it.
						<br><br>
						On behalf of the organisation, lots of success with your job and many thanks in advance for your cooperation.

						<h2>At the end of your shift</h2>
						Say goodbye to the manager volunteers, inform them of anything that they should know and release yourself from your shift.
