						<h2>To whom do I need to report?</h2>
						The person to whom you need to report is the Volunteer Manager. You will find them at the information desk.
						<h2>From whom do I take directions?</h2>
						Please only do as instructed by this information page or if one of the following people instructs you otherwise:
						<ul>
							<li>The presenters</li>
							<li>Someone from the orga team</li>
						</ul>
						<h2>How do I know when the blind date rounds are?</h2>
						You can find this in the competition live timetable as linked above. However, please pay close attention to the presenter in case there are changes.
						<h2>What are important times for me?</h2>
						The important times for you are:
						<ul>
							<li>The official welcome. You will play the official theme song to introduce the organizing committee. They will indicate the song to you.</li>
							<li>The blind date rounds.</li>
						</ul>
						<h2>What do I do when there is no blind date round happening?</h2>
						Please just play any music from the free dancing playlist. In case the presenter makes an announcement,
						please lower the volume temporarily before and while the presenter is speaking.
						<h2>What do I do during the blind date rounds?</h2>
						<ul>
							<li>In rounds 1 and 2 of both standard and latin, you will play 3 dances each and then again 3 dances each.</li>
							<li>In other words, for standard, it's SW TG QS SW TG QS.</li>
							<li>In every song, after every 30s of dancing you lower the volume for about 5-10 seconds for dancers to find another partner.</li>
							<li>For every dance you do 4 short sections of dancing.</li>
							<li>This means 4x(30+7.5)s = 2m30s for each dance.</li>
							<li>In total this leads to 15 minutes per round.</li>
							<br>
							<li>In rounds 3 of standard and latin, you will play only 3 dances but you will play 5 sections of music of each 30s, totalling a round of about 10 minutes.</li>
						</ul>

					<h2>Tournament music player</h2>
					<div class="left-align">
						<h2>To whom do I need to report?</h2>
						The person to whom you need to report is the Tournament Manager. This is Joanna Wytrzyszczewska at all times of the weekend. She will be found at the tournament desk.
						<h2>From whom do I take directions?</h2>
						Please only do as instructed by this information page or if one of the following people instructs you otherwise:
						<ul>
							<li>The tournament chairman or assistant chairman</li>
							<li>The tournament manager</li>
							<li>Someone from the orga team</li>
						</ul>
						<h2>How do I know how many heats there are?</h2>
						You can find this in the competition live timetable as linked above. However, please pay close attention to the presenter and the tournament desk in case there are changes.
						<h2>How long do I play?</h2>
						<ul>
							<li>During the qualification rounds (both breiten and open), as well as the general look of the beginners, you play for at most <b>1:15</b></li>
							<li>During all other rounds (except for the finals), you play for around <b>1:20 - 1:25</b></li>
							<li>During the finals, you play for <b>1:25 - 1:30</b></li>
						</ul>
						<br>
						Do note that the timing only starts from the first danceable beat. (This includes an intro with rhythm, but not one without)
						<br>
						The tournament desk choose to deviate from these timings.

						<h2>What do I do in between dances/heats/rounds/classes</h2>
						In between <b>dances or heats</b>, the ideal scenario is:
						<ul>
							<li>While the song is playing, you prepare your favorite filler.</li>
							<li>At the end of the time mentioned above, you fade out in about 3-5 seconds to 0 volume.</li>
							<li>You immediately start and fade in your favorite filler at a very low volume while the presenter leads the couples on/off the floor or to a next spot.</li>
							<li>BEFORE the presenter introduces the next dance, you fade out to silence.</li>
							<li>Then the presenter will say "Here is your &lt;insert dance&gt;."</li>
							<li>You start the next song.</li>
						</ul>
						<br>
						The goal is to have minimal time of silence. Only right after the dance (for a split-second), and before starting a new dance (while the presenter is announcing it) should there be silence.
						<br><br>
						In between <b>rounds/classes</b>, the ideal scenario is:
						<ul>
							<li>The exact same as above with one difference:</li>
							<li>After the last dance, instead of a filler, you play the theme song (specifically the edit that starts from the chorus).</li>
						</ul>
