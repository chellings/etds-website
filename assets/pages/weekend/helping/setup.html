						<h2>Where do I report?</h2>
						At the beginning of your shift you go to the tournament hall and look for the manager setup.
						Most likely, he will be walking around in a navy shirt and coordinating the process.
						He will be the one to give you a task.

						<h2>What are my tasks?</h2>
						In general you will be following the instructions given to you by the manager setup,
						this may include helping to build or remove the dance floor, under-floor, team tables, info desk, tournament desk, decorations, etc.

						<h2>What are important things to keep in mind?</h2>
						The equipment for lights and sound will be handled by technicians from the supplier, please do not touch this equipment unless specifically asked.

						<h2>I have a question!</h2>
						If you need anything or find yourself in a situation where you donâ€™t know what to do: contact the setup manager somewhere in the tournament hall.

						<h2>At the end of your shift</h2>
						Say goodbye to the manager setup, inform them of anything that they should know and release yourself from your shift.
