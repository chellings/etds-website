						<h2>Where do I report?</h2>
						At the beginning of your shift you go to the info desk and report to the manager volunteers; they will instruct you what to do.

						<h2>What are my tasks?</h2>
						Depending on whether blind dating is taking place, there will be two or three of you present at the information desk. (And possibly even one person virtually)
						There is always at least 1 person assigned to handling inquiries, while the rest handles blind date registration.
						<br><br>
						The information desk is where people come over if they have questions.
						These can be participants, team captains, crew and visitors.
						Your working place is situated next to the tournament stage.
						It is also your job to process suggestions and complaints about everything on stage,
						so the people on stage (tournament office, DJ, moderators) can do their jobs without being interrupted.

						<h2>Frequently asked questions</h2>
						If you notice the same question being asked more frequently, or the same issue arising frequently, it should be added to the Festival App.
						This is done by adding it to the FAQ list in the Google Sheet. The manager volunteers will know where to find it and how to access it.
						Similarly, if a FAQ is no longer relevant, please remove it.

						<h2>Lost & Found</h2>
						The info desk is also the place for lost and found. If it is an important item, please add it to the announcements in the Google Sheet.
						Upon retrieval, always ask the person to identify the item before handing it over.

						<h2>During blind dating</h2>
						Please give out the glow sticks that correspond to the colors the person needs to blind date in.
						You can find them <a href="/assets/img/weekend/blinddate.png" target="_blank">here</a>.
						<br><br>
						When two people found each other for the tournament(s), enter the couple in the tournament system.
						<br><br>
						Breitensport and beginner couples <b>may not</b> register with someone from the same team if they have to blind date.
						<br><br>
						Open class couples <b>may</b> register with someone from the same team,
						they may not have any training experience together, or have danced an xTDS together since 2019.
						There will not be any exceptions. If you are doubting whether a couple should be allowed to dance together (for example because you know the dancers)
						please ask the manager volunteers to contact Remy.
						<br><br>
						If it is busy, you may also guide people to register at the virtual check-in, if it is present.

						<h2>I have a question!</h2>
						If you need anything or find yourself in a situation where you donâ€™t know what to do: contact the manager volunteers.

						<h2>At the end of your shift</h2>
						Say goodbye to the manager volunteers, inform them of anything that they should know and release yourself from your shift.
