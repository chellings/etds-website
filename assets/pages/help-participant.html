					So... You cannot see the forest through the trees eh? (Pun intended)
					You can find all the basic information you need to know before and during the weekend right here on this page.
					We'll assume you have been to an ETDS (or NTDS) before. If not, check out the <a href="#/help-newbie">newcomers page</a>.
<!--					<br><br>-->
<!--					<span class="pink">★</span> <b>means changes in 2022</b>-->
					<br><br>
					For all questions, make sure you check with your team captain first. If they don't know, ask them to ask us.
					That way, we can keep all information flowing through the correct channels. If they don't respond, however,
					and you're panicking, then of course you can send us an email.
<!--					<br><br>-->
<!--					Would you rather have a single document you can have ready at all times, maybe even print out? (#notatreehugger).-->
<!--					Just download our mini-info-document. A single document that gives you all the information you could possibly need for the ETDS!-->
<!--					We will be updating the document if anything is unclear or as more information is added.-->

								That is correct. Every participant is expected to help out to make the ETDS happen. Only in this way can we keep the costs low.
								Every team is assigned a number of OHHs (Obligatory Helping Hours). Division of these goes through the team captain.

								Want to help out more? Great! You can enter this in the portal after <a href="https://fall.xtds.dance/">logging in</a>.
								If this doesn't work, or you don't know what to do, contact your team captain.
