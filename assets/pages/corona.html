						<h2>Approach to ETDS 2022</h2>
						The future is drawing closer! After more than two years of having to give up any hope of the ETDS happening,
						we are very hopeful that our ETDS can be held in October 2022!
						Today, our only focus is rekindling that dancing flame, turning forward that clock into the future,
						and get ready for ETDS 2022: ETDS 3030 Festival of the Future!

						<h2>Current situation</h2>
						The current situation in the Netherlands is that all travel is permitted (sometimes requiring vaccinations or negative tests)
						and that all events are allowed without restrictions.

						<h2>Our plan</h2>
						The plan that we will follow is to assume that the ETDS will take place as planned.
						We are also taking all precautions to reduce losses in the case that we do have to cancel the event.
						So we will do everything we can, to refund your money in case we do have to cancel the ETDS.

					<div class="left-align">
						<h2>Go/No-go date</h2>
						Our go/no-go date will be September 1st. This is where we ourselves decide whether the ETDS will take place or not given the (certainty of the) situation at that time.

						<h2>What if we have to cancel?</h2>
						If we have to cancel, we will do our best to refund all participants their money.

						<h2>Will I have to be vaccinated or show a negative Covid test?</h2>
						Currently, no restrictions are imposed by the Dutch government.
						We are copying their advice and therefore will not be requiring negative tests or proof of vaccination for the ETDS.
