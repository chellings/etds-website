				<hr>
				<p>
					The future is drawing ever closer. Therefore we decided to help you with the most important information all in one place!
					If you are missing anything here, please let your team captain know and we will add the information ASAP!

					Also, wouldn't it be nice if there was just one place that would contain all information during the ETDS weekend?
					Your wishes have been answered! Throughout the weekend, this website will transform into your very own festival app, complete with live timetable, announcements, FAQs, and so much more!
					To get accustomed to it, we will put a link to the app on our website in the week before.

					See you soon, in the future!

						<h2>Arrival</h2>
						The Festival starts at 19:00. Unless you're a helper assigned to a shift, please do not come before 19:00 as we will still be working hard to give you the best experience!

						<h2>Outfits</h2>
						We would like to remind everyone that having a theme outfit as well as a gala outfit is strongly encouraged!
						Make sure to add it to your packing list (it's already on the <a href="#/packing-list">interactive one</a>) and tell your team mates.

						For all directions to the venue, please check <a href="/#contact">the location info</a>. The venue has its own parking garage that is free.

						<h2>Sleeping halls & Lockers</h2>
						Sleeping halls <b>will close</b> during the tournament. Specifically from 11:00 - 16:00, both sleeping halls will be closed.
						In case of emergency, the key can be picked up at the information desk.
						<br><br>
						To give you the opportunity to safely store your items outside of the sleeping halls, lockers are available free of charge.

						<h2>Non-smoking campus</h2>
						A quick reminder that smoking is prohibited not only in the venue, but on the entire campus.

						<h2>Allergy information</h2>
						Allergy information can be found on the <a href="#/allergies">allergy page</a>. You can find the menus for both days on the <a href="#/menu">menu page</a>.

						<h2>Brunch</h2>
						Rather than having breakfast and lunch, there will be brunch. No need to rush to get food. However, we will strongly impose a limit to the amount of food you can take at once.
						Please take just one or two sandwiches at a time, and come back if you're still hungry.
						We would not like to see dried up and left over food on the team tables.
						<br><br>
						The menu and allergy information will be posted here one week before the start of the ETDS

						<h2>Dinner on Saturday</h2>
						Dinner on Saturday is <b>NOT</b> included. For those that have been going to ETDSses for longer, this is normal.
						However, in the past few editions, dinner was sometimes included. Therefore, we are just reminding you of this fact!
						<br><br>
						We kindly invite you to go out into the beautiful town of Delft.
						To help you on your way, please check this <a href="#/saturday">Where to eat on Saturday?</a> page for information on restaurants, travel info and more.
						<br><br>
						While it is not allowed to order food at the venue while the X Café is opened, you may choose to order food outside on the campus.
						Also, it is possible to get food at the venue's X Café. This requires a reservation <b>before 29/09 12:00</b> through the form on the <a href="#/saturday">Where to eat on Saturday?</a> page.
