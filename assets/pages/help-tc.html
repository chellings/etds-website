								This ETDS will have three main classes:
								<ul>
									<li>Beginners</li>
									<li>Breitensport</li>
									<li>Open</li>
								</ul>
								<br>
								Beginners are the dancers who dance for one and a half year or less and have no competition experience (including ETDS/NTDS).
								Because of the history with covid, we have decided to extend the cutoff for beginners to <b>March 1st</b>.
								<br><br>
								Both Breitensport and Open will have a qualification round. Subsequently, Breitensport will be divided into four classes: Amateurs, Professionals, Masters and Champions.
								Open will divided into two classes.
								<br><br>
								Please note that we will be stricter than past ETDSes on a dancer's actual placement in the open class.

								There are some rules regarding the blind dating which you can find <a href="#/blind-dating">here</a>.
								Basically, there are two kinds of blind dating during the ETDS; mandatory and voluntary.
								For the voluntary blind daters, there are no rules; they can dance with whomever they like!
								<br><br>
								For the mandatory blind dating we trust in the knowledge of the team captain. While the blind-dating page will give more detailed information,
								Any pair of dancers who have actively trained together before, danced competitions, or done an xTDS since 2016 are not allowed to dance together.
								One important difference is that Open class blind daters are allowed to dance with someone from the same team, while for Breitensport dancers this is not allowed.
								<br><br>
								For a Breitensport dancer who is obligated to blind date in their usual role as lead/follow,
								they may choose to dance in the opposite role and have no restrictions to the blind dating (i.e. voluntary blind dating).
								We trust the team captains use this rule within considerable limits.
