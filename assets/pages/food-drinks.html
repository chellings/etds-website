						<h2>Brunch</h2>
						Breakfast and lunch will be combined into a brunch. In other words, food wil be served continuously from 07:30 until about 14:30.
						Brunch will be a typical Dutch bread and condiment buffet. Early afternoon, a well-filled soup (vegan minestrone) will be added to the buffet.
						<br><br>
						Since the buffet is open continuously, you can also get food as often as you want. However, we have food estimates based on the number of people.
						Therefore, please be very careful to avoid food waste. If we notice large amounts of uneaten sandwiches on the table you may be reprimanded.

						<h2>Dinner</h2>
						Dinner will be served on Sunday. On Saturday, there will only be dinner supplied for the team captains.
						All other participants are invited to either:
						<ul>
							<li>Go into Delft city center and enjoy some amazing food in one of the many restaurants.</li>
							<li>Order an affordable meal at the X Café at the venue: €8,- which you can order <a href="https://forms.gle/ehdYvkQpVSsS9cCBA">here</a>. <b>(Until 29/09 12:00)</b>
