						<h2>Reasoning & Details</h2>
						We would like to inform you about an important change we are introducing to the tournament schedule, which we believe will enhance the overall experience for all participants.
						We will be implementing a new format for the tournament. Instead of dividing the field into Breitensport and (Cl)Open categories, we have decided to have a single tournament for each dance style.
						<br><br>This change brings several advantages that we believe will positively impact the event:
						<br>
						<ul>
							<li>A fair splitting of the field based on the shown dance skills (independent of formal class and avoiding the difficult comparability of the national class systems)</li>
							<li>Every couple will so be able to participate in the class, they really belong.</li>
							<li>Everybody will be allowed to participate with their favourite partner, regardless of the team affiliation and their formal class. No restrictions will be applied.</li>
							<li>For the higher classes, there will be the known lottery system for partnering during the tournament.</li>
						</ul>
						<br>There will be two rounds of qualification:
						<ul>
							<li>Qualification 1: Split 1 group into 2 groups</li>
							<li>Qualification 2: Split 2 groups into 8 categories:</li>
							<ul>
								<li>Enthusiasts</li>
								<li>Amateurs</li>
								<li>Professionals</li>
								<li>Masters</li>
								<li>Champions</li>
								<li>Legends</li>
								<li>Hellraisers</li>
								<li>Devils</li>
							</ul>
						</ul>
						After the two qualification rounds, the tournament will continue with preliminary rounds, the quarter-finals, semi-finals and finals. There will be no redance.
						<br><br>
						For the three highest categories (Legends, Hellraisers, Devils) there will be a lottery system for the partnering:
						<ul>
							<li><b>Legends:</b> Lottery per dance from the semi-finals</li>
							<li><b>Hellraisers:</b> Lottery per dance from the first round</li>
							<li><b>Devils:</b> Lottery per dance from the first round</li>
						</ul>

						<h2>Important conclusions</h2>
						<ul>
							<li>For all participants: Latin will be danced on saturday, Standard on sunday.</li>
							<li>The initial partner can be anyone. Even from your own team. Even your own competition partner.</li>
							<li>Everyone will have to dance two qualification rounds that ultimately place you and your partner in one of 8 categories.</li>
							<li>The highest 3 categories will get assigned a partner per dance by lottery either from the preliminary round or from the semi-final in that category.</li>
							<li>There will be no redance as everyone will have the chance to dance at least 3 times.</li>
						</ul>
